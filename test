(A) documnent parse 
Many financial documents and reports are saved in the format of PDF. It is known that searching and extracting useful information in pdfs are extremely inconvenient and tedious. This task becomes even more complicated if one needs to extract table data in pdfs. For one thing, therefore, a smart tool which is able to automatically detect tables in pdfs and precisely extract those tables is highly demanded. 

Smart PDF Parser which is based on novel ML technology. 
In the foillwong steps, extenad to scanned doucmeht, in the firmat of imgaes. 
The tool does not only apply to financial documents, can apply to any type of pdfs and images. It is now interegate this into product. Can also parse text, paragraphs and detect graphs and plots. A

Projection ways. 
Scanned images: object detect + ocr


Text part: detect: projection; ML-RNN; parse: math, 
Image part: detect: U-Net; YOLO; FRCNN; parse: ocr


(C) handwirtong: CV 
Way1: segmentation + CNN for each digit: find loc; seg (digits, symbols)-2rd run; clean; predict
Way2: cnn+rnn model: skip the segmentation, 


(B) nlp
Use reports to predict finainal index change 
Use previous model, parse text information 
Do word seg + no word seg; use latest technology; quickly adapt to;
